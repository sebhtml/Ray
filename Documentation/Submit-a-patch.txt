== Guidelines ==

You can clone the ray git repository.

	git clone git://github.com/sebhtml/ray.git

After making some changes to Ray, you can prepare a patch and send it on the
mailing list denovoassembler-devel AT lists.sourceforge.net

=== A good patch ===

A patch should:

- be concise
- address one issue/bug/feature (not many)
    (in that case, submit more than one patch)
- be easy to review
- should compile cleanly with -std=c++98 -Wall with g++
- should pass all system tests
- should pass all unit tests

=== A bad patch ===

A patch should not:

- change substantially the Ray architecture (i.e.: prototypes)
- contain changes related to unrelated issues (i.e. adding support for X _AND_ fixing bug Y)
     (in that case, submit more than one patch)


== git workflow ==


From http://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/


=== create a patch from changes to the master branch ===

git format-patch master --stdout > fix.patch

=== create a patch from a specific commit ===

you can create a patch from a commit too:

git format-patch -1 cdefecb3ab --stdout > fix.patch

=== check, sign and apply the patch (done by the maintainer of Ray) ===

git apply --stat fix.patch
git apply --check fix.patch
git am --signoff < fix.patch

=== Result ===

This will then show in the log:

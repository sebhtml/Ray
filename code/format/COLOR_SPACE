For color space:

* For sequencing reads, the starting nucleotide and first color are removed and the remaining colors are 'double-encoded'.
 - this doesn't make sense -- why remove information [particularly given Ray doesn't use quality values]
 - ... and double-encoding is *really* confusing

* The reverse-complement of a vertex is just its reverse.

* The resulting assembly is in color-space.

(not tested ...)
